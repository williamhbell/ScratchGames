# Scratch games for the Raspberry Pi

Written by W. H. Bell [ http://www.whbell.net/ ]

This package contains a collection of Scratch games that will work with Scratch 1.4, on the 
Raspberry Pi or any other computer with that version of Scratch.  Each directory contains a 
basic HTML file that can be opened in a local web browser, together with the Scratch source 
file.  The documentation files are in the doc/ directories, whereas the Scratch source files 
are in the src/ directories.
